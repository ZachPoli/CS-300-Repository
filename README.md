In the projects for this course, I tackled the challenge of developing a system to manage course information, emphasizing the relationships between different courses and their prerequisites. The crux of the solution hinged on understanding and aptly employing data structures, which are foundational in organizing data efficiently for varied operations. The correct data structure choice proved instrumental in ensuring optimal performance, especially with extensive data.

Throughout the journey, I faced obstacles such as my interpretation of the rubric of project 1. I was rushing and really forgot to do a lot of the work associated with that assignment. But the final project has profoundly influenced my software design approach, underscoring the need for scalability, adaptability, and future-centric design. Moreover, it has instilled in me the importance of crafting maintainable, readable, and adaptable code, emphasizing clean coding practices, thorough documentation, and modularity.
